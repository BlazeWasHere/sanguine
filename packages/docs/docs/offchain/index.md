# Participating in the Network

Anyone who is interested in participating in the Synapse Messaging network is free to do so. Contributors to Synapse Labs will provide a reference version of each agent type developed in the Go programming language, along with guidance on how to deploy things in the cloud of your choice.

You are free to configure things to select only a subset of the chains, so for example, you can run a Guard that decides to only handle some of the chains.

Of course, all of the agent types (Notary, Guard and Executor) will at times be required to perform transactions on the various chains, and this always requires Gas. The Synapse Messaging System is designed to collect enough value from the user who sends the message to pay for the Gas and also the additional rewards, because obviously the agents will not do work that causes them to lose money.
