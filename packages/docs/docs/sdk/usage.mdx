# Usage

How to use the SDK to create quotes and bridge transactions.

<!-- TODO: link to synapse router page -->
<!-- TODO: link to document providers -->

## Setting up your Environment

In order to begin constructing bridge related transactions, developers need to set up their environment for the relevant chains. The first is configuring chains and providers.

```typescript
//Set up providers (RPCs) for each chain desired

const arbitrumProvider: Provider = new etherProvider.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc'
)
const avalancheProvider: Provider = new etherProvider.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc'
)

//Structure arguments properly
const chainIds = [42161, 43114]
const providers = [arbitrumProvider, avalancheProvider]

//Set up a SynapseSDK instance
const Synapse = new SynapseSDK(chainIds, providers)
```

In the code snippet above, we set up the different providers and format them, along with the Ids of the chains we are bridging from/to for our quotes.

## Functions

### bridgeQuote()

Getting a bridge quote returns all relevant information regarding a possible transaction. Every bridge transaction requires this step.

#### Parameters

- `originChainId` - An integer representing the origin chain ID.
- `destChainId` - An integer representing the destination chain ID.
- `tokenIn` - A string representing the input token.
- `tokenOut` - A string representing the output token.
- `amountIn` - A BigintIsh representing the input token amount.

#### Return Value

A Promise object that resolves to an object with the following properties:

- `feeAmount` - A BigNumber object representing the fee amount for the transaction.
- `feeConfig` - A FeeConfig object representing the fee configuration for the transaction.
- `routerAddress` - A string representing the address of the router.
- `maxAmountOut` - A BigNumber object representing the maximum amount of tokens that can be received from the transaction (after fees).
- `originQuery` - A Query object representing the query to the origin SynapseRouter.
- `destQuery` - A Query object representing the query to the destination SynapseRouter.
