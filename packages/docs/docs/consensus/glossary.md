### State
Each chain in the network at a given point in time will have values set for the following properties that define its "state":
1. **Root** of merkle tree of messages that have been sent from this chain to another chain. Read more on [Merkle Trees](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/merkle-tree-in-blockchain).
2. **Origin Chain ID** is the chain id that identifies this particular blockchain.
3. **Nonce** is the number of messages that have been sent from this chain to another chain.
4. **Block Number** is the current block number of this chain's tip.
5. **Timestamp** is the time when the current tip was added to the chain.
